## What We Expect From You

<br>

### Graduation Requirements

<br>

#### HOMEWORK

Students must complete at least 80% on all homework assignments
For an assignment to be marked complete, students must complete 100% of the minimum tasks specified in that assignment.


####  PROJECTS
- Students must complete all of the minimum technical requirements for each unit project
- Parameters for minimum requirements will be explained when the project is assigned

####  ATTENDANCE 
- Have at least an 80% attendance record (you’ve missed 24 hours total or less of class)
- Attendance is taken at the start of every class meeting
- 3 late arrivals &/or early departures will constitute one absence
- Unexcused absences are not permitted unless it’s an exceptional circumstance
- Students who have been excessively absent may be withdrawn

You may have up to a three-day grace period period on a project for extenuating circumstances if you get approval before the due date.

Unexcused absences are not allowed. If you will have to miss a class, notify the IA/LI via Slack ahead of time so that we can mark your absence as excused. You may have a 48-hour grace period for notifying the IA/LI in case of emergency. Acceptable excuses include illness, death or critical illness to a family member of significant other, critical life emergency, and religious observances.

Students who have fulfilled all of the above requirements will receive a digital certificate of completion via email 1 week after to the course’s end.

Please feel free to contact your instructional team, or a member from student experience  if you have questions regarding this policy.


## Additional Expectations
* Take initiative.
* Ask for help.
* Practice, practice, practice.

### Classroom Culture

Let's all agree to:
* Treat each other with respect
* Avoid bringing distractions into class
* Participate in class
* Be on video with mute on during class

### How To Succeed in a Remote Environment

* Communication is key! Please respond in a "reasonable" timely manner if we contact you via slack or email.
* No distractions during class. This means no cell phones (talking/texting), television, or children around.
* Make sure to speak up and speak out about any problems you are having! Don't be afraid to ask questions during class! Someone else is probably having this same issue!
* Carve out at least 15-20 hours outside a class a week for review and homework. Expect the next 3 or so months to be out of the norm for you. If you have to carve out a personal hour during a family vacation, you will have to do this!
* Make use of office hours! Find a time that works for you and don't cancel on your instructors :)
* Hold yourself accountable. Don't let yourself fall behind!

## Group Work Formats
We will be using breakout rooms to get more personalized learning environments. Make sure to get to know your classmates and use each other as teachers!
