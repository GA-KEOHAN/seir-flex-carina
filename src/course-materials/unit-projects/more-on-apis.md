## Final Note on Selecting an API

Please be extremely thorough when finding an API you'd like to use for your project. In other words, please ensure you have properly vetted your API, by taking the time to read it's documentation and even "hitting a few endpoints". 

- practice some of the urls in the browser and make sure you can see the data
- make a practice ajax request see if you can console.log the data requested

Do this **BEFORE** you decide to seek instructor approval. 

This ensures you're taking the time to test the API and see how you can get it to respond with data and what that data looks like.
