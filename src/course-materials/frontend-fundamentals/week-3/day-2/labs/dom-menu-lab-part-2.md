## Intro

In the _DOM Events_ lesson we saw how to run a function, i.e., an event listener, when an event, such as a click, was dispatched.

This lab continues where Part 1 left off and provides practice defining event listeners used to manipulate the DOM in response to user interaction.  It also provides additional practice styling DOM elements dynamically using JavaScript.


<br>
<br>



### This exercises from the lab are not deliverable.

**However, if you'd like the challenge of completing them, please feel free to do so!**

<p style="color: crimson;"><b>We will only be evaluating up to task 3.1</b></p>

<br>



## Setup

1. Continue to use project inside your labs folder you created in Part 1. <br> This is what you should have thus far:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pWu6yHO.png">

2. Insert an additional `<nav>` element within the `<header>` element in **index.html**:

	```html
	<header>
	  <nav id="top-menu"></nav>
	  <!-- Add the <nav> element below -->
	  <nav id="sub-menu"></nav>
	</header>
	```

	> Note: Other than the above changes, **DO NOT** modify **index.html** in any way.

3. Add the following CSS to the bottom of **style.css**:

	```css
	header, #top-menu {
	  position: relative;
	}
	
	#top-menu {
	  z-index: 20;
	}
	
	#sub-menu {
	  width: 100%;
	  z-index: 10;
	  transition: top 0.5s ease-out;
	}
	
	#sub-menu a:hover {
	  background-color: var(--top-menu-bg);
	}
	
	nav a.active {
	  background-color: var(--sub-menu-bg);
	  color: var(--main-bg);
	}
	```

	> Note: Other than the above changes, **DO NOT** modify **style.css** in any way.

<br>


## Tasks

> Tasks 1.0 thru 3.1 were completed in Part 1.


<br>


#### Task 4.0

Select and cache the `<nav id="sub-menu">` element in a variable named `subMenuEl`.


<br>


#### Task 4.1

Set the height `subMenuEl` element to be `100%`.

<br>


#### Task 4.2

Set the background color of `subMenuEl` to the value stored in the `--sub-menu-bg` CSS custom property.

<br>


#### Task 4.3

Add the class of `flex-around` to the `subMenuEl` element.

<br>


#### Progress Check:

<br>



#### Task 4.4

Set the CSS `position` property of `subMenuEl` to the value of `absolute`.

<br>


#### Task 4.5

Set the CSS `top` property of `subMenuEl` to the value of `0`.


<br>


#### Task 5.0

Update the `menuLinks` array in **script.js** to this:

```javascript
var menuLinks = [
  {text: 'about', href: '/about'},
  {text: 'catalog', href: '#', subLinks: [
    {text: 'all', href: '/catalog/all'},
    {text: 'top selling', href: '/catalog/top'},
    {text: 'search', href: '/catalog/search'},
  ]},
  {text: 'orders', href: '#' , subLinks: [
    {text: 'new', href: '/orders/new'},
    {text: 'pending', href: '/orders/pending'},
    {text: 'history', href: '/orders/history'},
  ]},
  {text: 'account', href: '#', subLinks: [
    {text: 'profile', href: '/account/profile'},
    {text: 'sign out', href: '/account/signout'},
  ]},
];
```

<br>
<br>



#### Task 5.1

Select and cache the all of the `<a>` elements inside of `topMenuEl` in a variable named `topMenuLinks`.

Declare a global `showingSubMenu` variable and initialize it to `false`;


<br>


#### Task 5.2

Attach a delegated 'click' event listener to `topMenuEl`.

The first line of code of the event listener function should call the event object's `preventDefault()` method.

The second line of code function should immediately return if the element clicked was not an `<a>` element.

`console.log` the content of the `<a>` to verify the handler is working.

<br>


#### Progress Check

Ensure that clicking **ABOUT**, **CATALOG**, etc. logs out **about**, **catalog**, etc. when a link is clicked. 

Clicking anywhere other than on a link should do nothing.


<br>


#### Task 5.3

Next in the event listener, if the clicked `<a>` link has a class of `active`:

1. Remove the `active` class from the clicked `<a>` element.
2. Set the `showingSubMenu` to `false`.
3. Set the CSS `top` property of `subMenuEl` to `0`.
4. `return` to exit the handler.


<br>


#### Task 5.4

Next, the event listener should **remove** a class name of `active` from each `<a>` element in `topMenuLinks` - whether the `active` class exists or not.

**Hint:** Removing a non-existent class from an element does not cause an error, so just remove it!

<br>


#### Task 5.5

Next, the event listener should **add** a class name of `active` to the `<a>` element that was clicked.


<br>


#### Task 5.6

Set `showingSubMenu` to `true` if the clicked `<a>` element's "link" object within `menuLinks` has a `subLinks` property (all do, except for the "link" object for **ABOUT**), otherwise, set it to `false`.

**Hint:** Saving the "link" object in a variable will come in handy for passing its `subLinks` array in Task 5.7


<br>
<br>



#### Progress Check

Clicking any of the links should make that link "active" and clear the others:

Clicking an "active" link should clear that link.


<br>
<br>




#### Task 5.7

Next in the event listener...

If `showingSubMenu` is `true`:

1. Call a `buildSubMenu` function passing to it the `subLinks` array for the clicked `<a>` element.
2. Set the CSS `top` property of `subMenuEl` to `100%`.

Otherwise (`showingSubMenu` is `false`):

1. Set the CSS `top` property of `subMenuEl` to `0`.


<br>




#### Task 5.8

Code the `buildSubMenu` function so that it:

1. Clears the contents of `subMenuEl`.
2. Iterates over the `subLinks` array passed as an argument; and for each "link" object:
	- Create an `<a>` element.
	- On the new element, add an `href` attribute with its value set to the `href` property of the "link" object.
	- Set the new element's content to the value of the `text` property of the "link" object.
	- Append the new element to the `subMenuEl` element.

<br>
<br>




#### Progress Check

Take the menu for a test drive!

<br>



#### Task 6.0

Attach a delegated 'click' event listener to `subMenuEl`.

The first line of code of the event listener function should call the event object's `preventDefault()` method.

The second line of code function should immediately return if the element clicked was not an `<a>` element.

`console.log` the content of the `<a>` to verify the handler is working.

<br>



#### Task 6.1

Next, the event listener should:

1. Set `showingSubMenu` to `false`.
2. Set the CSS `top` property of `subMenuEl` to `0`.


<br>



#### Task 6.2

Remove the class name of `active` from each `<a>` element in `topMenuLinks` - whether the `active` class exists or not.


<br>


#### Task 6.3

Update the contents of `mainEl` to the contents of the `<a>` element, within an `<h1>`, clicked within `subMenuEl`.


<br>


#### Task 6.4

If the **ABOUT** link is clicked, an `<h1>about</h1>` should be displayed. 


<br>


#### Congrats!
