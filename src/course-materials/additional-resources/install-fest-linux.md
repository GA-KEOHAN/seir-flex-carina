# Install-Fest for Linux (Ubuntu 18.XX):


**Please note, this is a compilation of resources we've picked up on over time and may not encompass everything you need to install if you are running a Linux Operating System on your computer.**


**Also note the entire program is taught and demonstrated using a maching running MacOSX. That said, instructors may have limited experience working with a Linux laptop.** 

**So, please be advised there may be a diminished experience in the level of support instructors are able to offer for issues related specifically to linux.**
