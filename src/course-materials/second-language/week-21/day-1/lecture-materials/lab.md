## Introduction

#### Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego?

We're going to use what we've learned already about searching with SQL commands, and apply it to chase down and capture an elusive and world-renowned thief, Carmen Sandiego. Follow the clues, use the documentation - write down **both** the SQL commands /queries you used and your answers to the clues (in the [find_carmen.sql](find_carmen.sql) file)- and figure out where Carmen's headed, so we can catch her and bring her in.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

Copy the following SQL into your bit.io query editor:

[Open this file in VSCode and copy contents to bit.io SQL editor to seed database](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gPalRxQc2KfoxhzYZ2lDb5XWt5GnED2k/view?usp=share_link)

Create a file called answers.sql locally and edit with VSCode with the following.

```sql
-- TEST COMMAND AND SAMPLE OUTPUT
-- Record your query (or queries, some clues require more than one) below the clue, then comment out the output below it
-- use two `-` to comment at the start of a line, or highlight the text and press `⌘/` to toggle comments
-- EXAMPLE: SELECT ALL FROM THE TABLE COUNTRY AND LIMIT IT TO ONE ENTRY

SELECT * FROM COUNTRY LIMIT 1;

--  -[ RECORD 1 ]--+--------------------------
-- code           | AFG
-- name           | Afghanistan
-- continent      | Asia
-- region         | Southern and Central Asia
-- surfacearea    | 652090
-- indepyear      | 1919
-- population     | 22720000

-- Clue #1: We recently got word that someone fitting Carmen Sandiego's description has been traveling through Southern Europe. She's most likely traveling someplace where she won't be noticed, so find the least populated country in Southern Europe, and we'll start looking for her there.



-- Clue #2: Now that we're here, we have insight that Carmen was seen attending language classes in this country's officially recognized language. Check our databases and find out what language is spoken in this country, so we can call in a translator to work with you.




-- Clue #3: We have new news on the classes Carmen attended – our gumshoes tell us she's moved on to a different country, a country where people speak only the language she was learning. Find out which nearby country speaks nothing but that language.




-- Clue #4: We're booking the first flight out – maybe we've actually got a chance to catch her this time. There are only two cities she could be flying to in the country. One is named the same as the country – that would be too obvious. We're following our gut on this one; find out what other city in that country she might be flying to.




-- Clue #5: Oh no, she pulled a switch – there are two cities with very similar names, but in totally different parts of the globe! She's headed to South America as we speak; go find a city whose name is like the one we were headed to, but doesn't end the same. Find out the city, and do another search for what country it's in. Hurry!




-- Clue #6: We're close! Our South American agent says she just got a taxi at the airport, and is headed towards the capital! Look up the country's capital, and get there pronto! Send us the name of where you're headed and we'll follow right behind you!




-- Clue #7: She knows we're on to her – her taxi dropped her off at the international airport, and she beat us to the boarding gates. We have one chance to catch her, we just have to know where she's heading and beat her to the landing dock.

-- Lucky for us, she's getting cocky. She left us a note, and I'm sure she thinks she's very clever, but if we can crack it, we can finally put her where she belongs – behind bars.

-- Our playdate of late has been unusually fun –
-- As an agent, I'll say, you've been a joy to outrun.
-- And while the food here is great, and the people – so nice!
-- I need a little more sunshine with my slice of life.
-- So I'm off to add one to the population I find
-- In a city of ninety-one thousand and now, eighty five.


-- We're counting on you, gumshoe. Find out where she's headed, send us the info, and we'll be sure to meet her at the gates with bells on.




-- She's in ____________________________!

Then, use the clues in answers.sql and below to create the appropriate SQL queries to help you find Carmen and then, tell us where she's heading!!. Don't forget to git commit when you've found her!

When your done you'll turn in your answers.sql with the queries you ran to get to your final answer.

### The Clues

  - **Clue #1:** We recently got word that someone fitting Carmen Sandiego's description has been traveling through Southern Europe. She's most likely traveling someplace where she won't be noticed, so find the least populated country in Southern Europe, and we'll start looking for her there.

  - **Clue #2:** Now that we're here, we have insight that Carmen was seen attending language classes in this country's officially recognized language. Check our databases and find out what language is spoken in this country, so we can call in a translator to work with you.

### Hungry for more?
Some of the entries have gotten a bit messed up. For example, the capital of Brazil is not `Brasï¿½lia`, rather, it is Brasília. Update this entry to the correct spelling. Record your update, in the find_carmen.sql file (below `I found Carmen`), and do a query for one row and copy paste it to show the update.

Update any other two entries that have gotten messed up.
