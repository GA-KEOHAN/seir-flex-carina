# React Router

Spin a new react up using create-react-app

<!-- Previous solution Look over the working [Solution](https://vhixt.csb.app/) -->
Look over the working [Solution](https://xupn0g.csb.app/) and examine the app in React Dev Tools to see if you can elicit the structure so that you have a starting point for you app. 

This version of the application should use hard-coded stocks data, which you can find in create a data.json file with the data below to use. however if you want to leverage pulling data from an API you can sign up for an API key and use [https://financialmodelingprep.com/](https://financialmodelingprep.com/)

data for your data.json file, just copy and paste it into a new data.json file in your src folder and then import the file. `import data from "./data.json"`

```json
[
  {name: "Apple Inc.", symbol: "AAPL", lastPrice: 140.64, change: -0.280000000000001, high: 141.74, low: 140.35, open: 141.5},
  {name: "Microsoft Corporation", symbol: "MSFT", lastPrice: 64.98, change: 0.109999999999999, high: 65.45, low: 64.76, open: 65.12},
  {name: "Alphabet Inc.", symbol: "GOOGL", lastPrice: 835.14, change: -4.50999999999999, high: 844, low: 829.1, open: 842},
  {name: "Facebook, Inc.", symbol: "FB", lastPrice: 140.34, change: 0.810000000000002, high: 141.0244, low: 139.76, open: 140.08},
  {name: "Oracle Corporation", symbol: "ORCL", lastPrice: 44.65, change: -0.300000000000004, high: 45.09, low: 44.575, open: 44.91},
  {name: "Intel Corporation", symbol: "INTL", lastPrice: 36.16, change: -0.370000000000005, high: 36.78, low: 36.125, open: 36.58}
]
```

Here is your routing table. So when your app is complete it should have all the routes below.

| Route | Renders                                   | Component        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| /      | "This is the Homepage page"                    | Home             |
| /about     | "This is theAabout page"| About |
| /stocks/:symbol     | A single stock                         | Stock      |
| /stocks   | All stocks      | Dashboard    |

Your stock tracking app should have the following features...

## Navigation

No matter what route the user is visiting, they should always see a navigation bar at the top of the window. It should contain links to "Home" and "About" pages.

## Dashboard (`/stocks`)

If a user visits `/stocks` or clicks "Home" in the navigation bar, they should be directed to a dashboard page. This page should list all of the stocks that the user is tracking, specifically their `name` and `symbol`. These stocks should be pulled from [`stock-data.js`](./stock-data.js).

**Bonus:** Try rendering the stocks as per the image below.

## Stock (`/stocks/:symbol`)

If a user clicks on one of the stocks listed in the Dashboard view, they should be directed to an individual stock show view. This view should display all of a stock's attributes.

> The resources listed at the bottom of the [readme](README.md) might come in handy when building this out.

## About (`/about`)

If a user clicks on "About" in the navigation bar, they should be directed to an about page. This is just a static page that displays a description of your app.
