#### Setup

- This lesson builds upon the `express-todos` project created in the previous lesson. Make sure that you're in this folder and have it open in your text editor.

<br>
<br>
<br>




#### What is Middleware?


- In the Intro to Express lesson, we identified the three fundamental capabilities provided by web application frameworks:
	1. The ability to define routes
	2. The ability to process HTTP requests using middleware
	3. The ability to use a view engine to render dynamic templates

- We've already defined routes and rendered dynamic templates.

- In this lesson we complete the trifecta by processing requests using middleware.


- A middleware is simply a function with the following signature:

```javascript
function(req, res, next) {}
```

- As you can see, middleware have access to the _request_ (`req`) and _response_ (`res`) objects - this allows middleware to modify them in anyway they see fit.

- Once a middleware has done its job, it either calls `next()` to pass control to the next middleware in the pipeline **or** ends the request as we've been doing with the `render` & `redirect` methods...


- Yes, actually you have already written middleware - the controller actions, `todosCtrl.index` & `todosCtrl.show`, are middleware!
	
- The controller middleware functions didn't need to define the `next` parameter because they were at the **end of the middleware pipeline**.  That is, they ended the request/response cycle by calling a method on the `res` object, e.g., `res.render`.

- The `next` function is also used for error handling.


- There's no better way to understand middleware than to see one in action.

- Open **server.js** and add this "do nothing" middleware:

```javascript
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// add middleware below the above line of code
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
 console.log('Hello Intrepid Learner!');
 next();
});
```
- Type `nodemon` to start the server, browse to `localhost:3000`, and check terminal. 

<br>
<br>
<br>





#### Our First Middleware


- Note that `app.use` mounts middleware functions into the middleware pipeline.

- Let's add a line of code that modifies the `req` object: 

```javascript
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
 console.log('Hello Intrepid Learner!');
 // Add a time property to the req object
 req.time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
 next();
});
```

- Now let's pass this info to the **todos/index.ejs** view...


- It's the responsibility of controllers to pass data to views.

- Let's update the `index` action in **controllers/todos.js** so that it passes `req.time`:

```javascript
function index(req, res) {
 res.render('todos/index', {
   todos: Todo.getAll(),
   time: req.time  // add this line
 });
}
```


- Now let's render the time in **todos/index.ejs** by updating the `<h1>` as follows:

```html
<h1>Todos as of <%= time %></h1>
```

- Refresh!


- The order that middleware is mounted matters!

- In **server.js**, let's move our custom middleware below where the routers are being mounted:

```javascript
app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/todos', todosRouter);

app.use(function(req, res, next) {
 console.log('Hello Intrepid Learner!');
 req.time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
 next();
});
```

- Refresh shows that it no longer works :(

- Move it back above the routes - that's better.

<br>
<br>
<br>





#### Key Middleware

- Here are some other pieces of middleware we'll need as we scale our application

- **morgan**: An `HTTP` logger that "logs" requests in the terminal.

- **express.urlencoded** (formerly known as `body-parser`): Parses data sent in the body of the request and populates a `req.body` object containing that data.

- **express.static**: Serves _static assets_, such as css, js and image files.

- The only one we need to install is `morgan` because everything else is included when we install `express`. 

```bash
  npm i morgan 
```

Now we require `morgan` and mount it as middleware

```javascript
const morgan = require('morgan');
```

<br>


**We'll mount Morgan like this**

```javascript
app.use(morgan('dev'));
```

**Next, we'll mount our static asset middleware and bodyparser middleware**


```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```


**...by the end, is what our "Middleware Stack" should look like**

```javascript

// Mount middleware (app.use)
app.use(morgan('dev'));
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/todos', todosRouter);
```

For our static assets, we'll create a `public` folder at the root of our project and the place a `css`, `js`, and `images` subdirectory inside of it (we can also create a `style.css` and `script.js` file inside the appropriate sub-directories as well). 

This is where our stylesheets, images and front-end javascript will live!

<br>

While we're at it, let's make sure all of our templates have a link tag so they can use any CSS rules we've defined in `style.css`

<br>

**Add the following `link` tag to all of your template files ...(files that end with the .ejs extension inside of the `views` directory)**

```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">
```

<br>
<br>
<br>




#### Express Request-Response Cycle


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HMRyxyl.png">



**Here's a great flow to follow when you want to add functionality to your web app:**
<br>
1. Identify the "proper" Route (Verb + Path)
2. Create the UI that issues a request that matches that route.
3. Define the route on the server and map it to a controller action.
4. Code and export the controller action.
5. `res.render` a view in the case of a `GET` request, or `res.redirect` if data was changed. 


What functionality do we want? Do we want to show a form on the `index` view, or do we want a separate page dedicated to adding a To Do? Typically, you'd want have the form on the same page, however, for completeness, we'll use the dedicated page approach.

- Checking the [Resourceful Routing for CRUD Operations in Web Applications Chart](https://gist.github.com/myDeveloperJourney/dfb5b8728c54fce5e0e997ac3ce466a0), we find that the proper route is:

```shell
GET /todos/new
```


- Next step is to add a link in **views/todos/index.ejs** that will invoke this route:

```html
...
 </ul>
 <a href="/todos/new">Add To-Do</a>
</body>
```
	
- Step 2 is done. On to step 3 - defining the route on the server...

- Let's add the `new` route in **routes/todos.js** as follows:

```javascript
router.get('/', todosCtrl.index);
router.get('/new', todosCtrl.new);
router.get('/:id', todosCtrl.show);
```

- Why must the `new` route be defined before the `show` route?

- Step 4 says to code the `todosCtrl.new` action we just mapped to the `new` route:

- In **controllers/todos.js**:

```javascript
module.exports = {
 index,
 show,
 new: newTodo
};


function newTodo(req, res) {
 res.render('todos/new');
}

// original code below...
```

- Note that you cannot create a function using a JS _reserved_ word like `new`.

- Now we need that `new` view.

- Create **views/todos/new.ejs**, copy over the boilerplate from another view, then put this good stuff in there:

```html
<body>
 <h1>New Todo</h1>
 <form action="/todos" method="POST" autocomplete="off">
   <input type="text" name="text">
   <button type="submit">Save Todo</button>
 </form>
</body>
```

<br>
<br>
<br>





#### Creating To-Dos


- FYI that `autocomplete="off"` attribute will prevent the sometimes annoying autocomplete feature of inputs.

- Verify that clicking the **Add To-Do** link displays the page with the form...


- Performing a Create data operation using a form is a two-request process.

- If you remember the routing chart from our last lesson, we can see the proper (RESTful) route is...

```shell
POST /todos
```

**That's why the form's attributes have been set to:**
- `action="/todos"`
- `method="POST"`

- Check [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Your_first_HTML_form) out if you want to learn more about HTML Forms.


Same process:
1. Determine proper route - check!
2. Create UI - check!
3. Define the route on the server - next...



- In **routes/todos.js**:

```javascript
router.get('/:id', todosCtrl.show);
router.post('/', todosCtrl.create);  // add this route
```

- Yay! Our first non-`GET` route!


#### Creating To-Dos (Cont)


Same process:
1. Determine proper route - check!
2. Create UI - check!
3. Define the route on the server - check!
4. Code and export the controller action - next...



In **controllers/todos.js**:

```javascript
  	  ...
  	  create
  	};
  	
  	function create(req, res) {
  	  console.log(req.body);
  	  req.body.done = false;
  	  Todo.create(req.body);
  	  res.redirect('/todos');
  	}
```

**Temporarily comment out the `Todo.create(req.body);` line so that we can check out what gets logged out...**


- `req.body` is courtesy of this middleware in **server.js**:
	
```javascript
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```

- The properties on `req.body` will always match the values of the `<input>`'s `name` attributes:

```html
<input type="text" name="text">
```


- We already did Step 5 with the `res.redirect`.

- All we need is that `create` in **models/todo.js**:

```javascript
module.exports = {
 getAll,
 getOne,
 create
};

const todos = [
   {text: 'Feed Dogs', done: true},
   {text: 'Learn Express', done: false},
   {text: 'Buy Milk', done: false}
  ];

function create(todo) {
 todos.push(todo);
}

// Original code below
```

- Test it out!

- Note that when `nodemon` restarts the server, added to-dos will be lost.

### <span style="text-transform:lowercase">method-override</span> Middleware


- Again, referring back to our routing chart from our routing lesson, performing full-CRUD data operations requires that the browser send `DELETE` & `PUT` requests.

- Using JavaScript (AJAX), the browser can send HTTP requests with any method, however, HTML can only send `GET` & `POST` methods. So what do we do if we want to delete a To-Do?

- [method-override](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override) middleware to the rescue!


- Using `method-override` allows browsers to inform the server that it actually wants it to consider the request it sends to be something other than a `POST` - as you'll soon see, we'll be using forms with method="POST".

- First we need to install the middleware:

	```shell
	$ npm i method-override
	```


- Require it below `morgan` in **server.js**:

```javascript
const morgan = require('morgan');
const methodOverride = require('method-override');
```

- Now let's add `method-override` to the middleware pipeline:

```javascript
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));  // add this
```

- We are using the [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string) approach for `method-override` as documented [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override#override-using-a-query-value).

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>




#### Delete a To-Do


- The user story reads:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_As a User, I want to delete a To Do from the list_

- Same process:
	1. Determine proper route

- The RESTful route is:

```shell
DELETE /todos/:id
```


- Same process:
	1. Determine proper route - check!
	2. Create UI - next...


- By default, `method-override` only listens for `POST` requests.

- Therefore, we'll use a `<form>` for the UI in **views/todos/index.ejs**:

```html
  <% todos.forEach(function(t, idx) { %>
    <li>
      <form action="/todos/<%= idx %>?_method=DELETE"
        class="delete-form" method="POST">
        <button type="submit">X</button>
      </form>
```

- The `?_method=DELETE` is the query string.


- Let's some styling in **public/css/style.css**:

```css
.delete-form {
 display: inline-block;
 margin-right: 10px;
}

.delete-form button {
 color: red;
}

li {
 list-style: none;
 margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

- Refresh and use DevTools to ensure the links look correct.


- Same process:
	1. Determine proper route - check!
	2. Create UI - check!
	3. Define the route on the server - next...


- I bet you could have done this one on your own!

- In **routes/todos.js**:

```javascript
router.post('/', todosCtrl.create);
router.delete('/:id', todosCtrl.delete);
```


Same process:
1. Determine proper route - check!
2. Create UI - check!
3. Define the route on the server - check!
4. Code and export the controller action - next...


- Similar to `newTodo`, we can't name a function `delete`, so...

```javascript
 create,
 delete: deleteTodo
};

function deleteTodo(req, res) {
 Todo.deleteOne(req.params.id);
 res.redirect('/todos');
}
```


- All that's left is to add the `deleteOne` method to the `Todo` model:

```javascript
module.exports = {
 getAll,
 getOne,
 create,
 deleteOne
};

const todos = [
 {text: 'Feed Dogs', done: true},
 {text: 'Learn Express', done: false},
 {text: 'Buy Milk', done: false}
];

function deleteOne(id) {
 todos.splice(id, 1);
}

// Original code below
```

**Does it work? Of course it does!**

<br>
<br>
<br>





### 💪 Exercises: Update a To-Do



**Updating a To-Do is very similar to creating one because it also is a two-request process:**
1. One request to display a form used to edit the To-Do.
2. Another request to submitted the form to the server so that it can update the To-Do.


<br>
<br>



#### Update a To-Do


##### Exercise #1:

**_As a User, when viewing the show page for a To-Do, I want to be able to click a link to edit the text of the To-Do_**


##### Exercise #2:

**_As a User, when editing a To-Do, I want to be able to toggle whether or not it's done_**


- **Hints:**
	- Follow the same steps we followed multiple times for adding functionality!
	- Be sure to reference the Routing Chart to determine the proper routes!
	- You will want to pre-fill the `<input>` with the todo text - use the `value` attribute and some EJS to pull this off.
	- Don't forget that the controller action will first have to get the To-Do being edited so that it can be sent to the view.


- **Hints for Exercise #2 (Toggling `done`):**
	- Use an `<input type="checkbox" ...>`
	- Checkboxes are checked when a `checked` attribute exists (no value is assigned).
	- Use a ternary expression to write in the `checked` attribute, or an empty string.
	- If the checkbox is checked when submitted, `req.body.done` will have the value of `"on"`, otherwise there won't even be a `req.body.done` property.

- **Enjoy!**
